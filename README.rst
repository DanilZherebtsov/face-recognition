The `main.py` function contains a complete face recognition pipeline illustrating the one-shot-learning approach.

The code is dependent on python 3.7 and the requirements.txt. Have those set up and and run the `main.py` script.

It will first take your picture, prompt you to input the name of the person on the picture. This step will add a new person to the database.

Then it will take another picture of the person you want to recognize and tell you if this person recognized.

The `main.py` script is a good starting point to build your own face recognition pipeline.
