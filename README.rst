Supporting code and prequisits for a YouTube `video <https://youtu.be/P0bcGZ88OGs>`_

The `main.py` function contains a complete face recognition pipeline illustrating the one-shot-learning approach.

Prequisits
----------
The code is dependent on python 3.7 and the requirements.txt. 

Usage
-----

1. Run the `main.py` script.

2. It will first take your picture, prompt you to input the name of the person on the picture. This step will add a new person to the database.

3. Then it will take another picture of the person you want to recognize and tell you if this person recognized.

The `main.py` script is a good starting point to build your own face recognition pipeline.
